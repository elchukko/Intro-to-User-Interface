					<h1>Why Should I Get a Certification?</h1>
					  
					<p>Certifications are worth the investment. They give you an edge on the competition in a job search or help you move up within the ranks in your current organization.</p>

					<p id="comptiaQuote">The <a href="http://www.comptia.org">CompTIA</a> testing organization notes that "In Q3 2014, IT positions made up 11% of all job openings, and IT certifications can help get you in the door. An overwhelming majority of IT professionals and their hiring managers agree on the value of certifications. 93% of hiring managers believe certifications are beneficial."</p>

					<p>Businesses want certifications because it shows definitively that the talent they hire can perform at a certain level. </p>

					<p>Furthermore, research shows that the learning curve is much shorter for a certified IT worker than it is for a noncertified counterpart. Certified workers are more likely to fix problems right the first time and are more adept at anticipating issues and resolving them before they become major problems.</p>

                <section id="softskills">
